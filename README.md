# xpcc: C++ microcontroller framework

**xpcc is now deprecated and this repo has been archived since 2019!**  
**Use [these instructions to port your code](https://github.com/modm-io/modm/blob/develop/docs/porting_xpcc_to_modm.md) to the successor library [modm](https://modm.io).**  
**Ping [@salkinium](https://github.com/salkinium) for answers to your questions.**

modm has significantly improved on the code generation ideas we've prototyped in xpcc, both in breadth (more devices supported) and depth (more accurate data). Check out [how modm works](https://modm.io/how-modm-works) and [how you can get started](https://modm.io/guide/getting-started) with it.

We've had some fantastic engineers volunteer their time on this project over the years, to all of you a big **THANK YOU**! All your contributions have been ported to modm already.

**We're looking forward to even more collaboration with you in modm's future!**
